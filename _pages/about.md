<b>I am a Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Researcher at the University of Cambridge</b> with 14 years of experience designing and leading complex programmes to address global challenges. My [current research](projects/8_project) investigates machine learning and remote sensing techniques to detect and conserve biodiverse old-growth forests.

<b>From [2013 to 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomratsakatika/), I served as an Economic Development Expert with the British Diplomatic Service</b>, leading private sector development, investment and climate change policy and programmes.

- Designing a [£35m programme to catalyse agribusiness and forest carbon investments](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300116/summary) in Tanzania.
- Managing a [£35m programme to deploy 100 solar mini-grids](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300303/summary) in villages across Sierra Leone.
