<b>I am a Machine Learning and Remote Sensing Researcher at the University of Cambridge</b> with 14 years of experience applying technical, strategic and implementation expertise to complex global challenges. My [current research](projects/8_project) investigates machine learning and remote sensing techniques to detect and conserve biodiverse old-growth forests.

<b>From [2013 to 2023](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomratsakatika/), I was an Economic Development Adviser with the British Diplomatic Service</b>, leading on private sector development, investment and climate change policy. I managed multidisciplinary teams during postings in three countries and secured over <b>£85m</b> for programme implementation. [My work](projects) included:

- Managing a <b>£35m</b> programme to [deploy 100 solar mini-grids](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300303/summary) in villages across Sierra Leone.
