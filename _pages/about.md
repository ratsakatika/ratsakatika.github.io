I am an Artificial Intelligence and Environment Researcher at the University of Cambridge with 14 years of experience applying strategic, analytical, and implementation expertise to global challenges.

Previously, I served as an International Development Expert with the British Diplomatic Service (2013-2023). [My work](projects) included:

- Leading one of the UK's largest market systems development projects in DRC,
- Designing initiatives to facilitate forest carbon project development in Tanzania,
- Overseeing the installation of 100 solar mini-grids in villages across Sierra Leone.

I played strategic roles in multiple countries, leading on private sector development and climate policy while securing over £85m for project implementation.

I am a Chartered Financial Analyst with Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering for Sustainable Development. I am pursuing a PhD in AI and Environmental Risk at the University of Cambridge. My research will analyse diverse satellite and drone datasets to monitor deforestation and biodiversity in the Carpathian Mountains.
