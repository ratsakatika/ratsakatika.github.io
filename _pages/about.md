<b>I am an AI and Environmental Risk Researcher at the University of Cambridge, </b> with 14 years of experience applying technical, strategic, and implementation expertise to global challenges. [My research](projects/8_project) applies machine learning to satellite, drone, and 3D point cloud data to detect and protect biodiverse forest ecosystems.

<b>From 2013 to 2023, I served as an International Development Expert with the British Diplomatic Service,</b> leading private sector development, investment and climate policy in multiple countries and securing over £85m for programme implementation.

<b>I have led teams in challenging and complex contexts.</b> [My work](projects) includes:

- Leading a [£50m market systems development programme](https://www.elan-rdc.com/home) to enhance livelihoods in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
- Designing a £35m programme to [catalyse agribusiness and forest carbon investments](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300116/summary) in Tanzania.
- Managing a £35m programme to [deploy 100 solar mini-grids](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/programme/GB-GOV-1-300303/summary) in villages across Sierra Leone.
- Developing a novel [AI-based wildlife alert system](https://github.com/ratsakatika/camera-traps) to mitigate human-wildlife conflict in Romania.

<b>I am currently pursuing a PhD with [Professor Lines](https://www.linesresearchgroup.com/) and am open to consultancy roles.</b> I hold Master’s degrees in Aerospace Engineering, Engineering for Sustainable Development and Environmental Data Science.
