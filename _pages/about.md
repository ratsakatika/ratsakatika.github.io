I am an Artificial Intelligence and Environmental Science Researcher with extensive experience applying advanced analytics and policy expertise to global challenges.

I was previously an International Development Expert with the British Diplomatic Service (2013-2023) where I designed and led renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and conservation initiatives across multiple countries, securing over Â£85m of public investment. I have worked with governments to increase their climate change ambition and develop supportive policies for renewable energy investment. I am skilled at engaging on complex, technical issues and managing teams to deliver solutions that influence the wider economic, political and social context.

I am a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) with Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering for Sustainable Development. I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Cambridge.
