<b> I am an AI and Environmental Risk Researcher at the University of Cambridge </b> with 13 years of experience in applying technical, strategic, and implementation expertise to global challenges. My current research leverages machine learning to analyse data from satellites, drones and 3D point cloud models to assess deforestation and biodiversity.

<b> From 2013-2023, I served as an International Development Expert with the British Diplomatic Service.</b> I played strategic roles in multiple countries, leading on private sector development and climate policy while securing over £85m for project implementation. [My work](projects) included:

- Leading one of the UK's largest market systems development projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
- Designing initiatives to facilitate forest carbon investments in Tanzania,
- Overseeing the installation of 100 solar mini-grids in villages across Sierra Leone.

I hold Master’s degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering for Sustainable Development and the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.
